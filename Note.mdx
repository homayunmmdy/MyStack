Versions of the npm packages in the dependencies section of your package.json file follow what’s called Semantic Versioning (SemVer), an industry standard for software versioning aiming to make it easier to manage dependencies. Libraries, frameworks or other tools published on npm should use SemVer in order to clearly communicate what kind of changes projects can expect if they update.

Knowing SemVer can be useful when you develop software that uses external dependencies (which you almost always do). One day, your understanding of these numbers will save you from accidentally introducing breaking changes to your project without understanding why things that worked yesterday suddenly don’t work today. This is how Semantic Versioning works according to the official website:

"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that won’t work with earlier versions.

In `package.json`, the tilde (`~`) before a version number means:

**"Install this exact version or the latest patch update."**

Example: `~1.2.3` allows `1.2.3` to `1.2.x` (but not `1.3.0`).

Yes, exactly!

With `~1.2.3` in `package.json`:

- ✅ It will update to the latest **patch** version within `1.2.x` (e.g., `1.2.9`).
- ❌ It will **not** jump to `1.3.0` (a **minor** update).

So, if `1.2.9` exists, it installs that not `1.3.0`.

Short: `~` = "only patch updates, no minor/major." 🔄

In `package.json`, the caret (`^`) before a version number means:

**"Install this version or compatible minor/patch updates (but no breaking major changes)."**

### Example: `^1.2.3` allows:

- ✅ `1.2.3` (exact)
- ✅ `1.2.9` (latest patch)
- ✅ `1.3.0` (minor update)
- ❌ **NOT** `2.0.0` (major update, breaking changes)

### Short Rule:

- `^` = "safe updates (minor & patches, no major)." 🚦

_(Note: If major version is `0` (e.g., `^0.2.3`), it behaves like `~` only patches, since `0.x` = unstable.)_

## Send log into / route

```javascript
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.send("Hello Express");
});
```

## Send and load file into route

```javascript
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/views/index.html");
});
```

middleware are functions that intercept route handlers, adding some kind of information

## Public Middleware

When you add `app.use('/public', express.static(__dirname + '/public'))`:

1. Any request starting with `/public` (like `/public/style.css`) will look in your `/public` folder
2. Express automatically serves the matching file (like `style.css`) from that folder
3. Your HTML can now use `/public/style.css` and it will work

Result: Your webpage loads CSS/images/JS from the `/public` folder.

## Server JSON by route

```javascript
app.get("/json", function (req, res) {
  res.json({ message: "Hello json" });
});
```

## Middleware

Middleware is like a **helper function** that runs every time your server gets a request. It can:

- Check something (like if a user is logged in).

- Log information (like which page was requested).

- Modify the request or response.

- Decide whether to continue or stop the request.

Middleware takes 3 arguments: (req, res, next).
It runs code, can modify req/res, and must call next() to proceed.

for example here a middleware
This code logs every incoming request to your Express server in the format `"METHOD PATH - IP"` (like `GET /about - ::1`) and then passes control to the next middleware using `next()`. It's a basic request logger for debugging.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.method + " " + req.path + " - " + req.ip);
  next();
});
```

## middleware chaining

applying multiple middleware function in a sequential order to handle a request

```javascript
app.get(
  "/now",
  (req, res, next) => {
    req.time = new Date().toString(); // Middleware sets up data
    next(); // Pass to next function
  },
  (req, res) => {
    res.json({ time: req.time }); // Final handler sends response
  }
);
```
